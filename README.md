This is the soon-to-be home of all [F7u12 subreddit][1] css.

##Instructions

Please place all faces in `sass/_faces.scss` and all user/moderator styles in `sass/_users.scss`

`sass/style.scss` is the main stylesheet, if its not a face or a user-style, it can go in here.

We can also make SASS handle and render sprites for us.

More to come soon

##Required Reading
Before you start editing, please take the time to at least read the [tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html). It is very useful, and prevents people from raging.

Additionally, if you feel up to it, the whole [Sass Reference](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) is very good.

Finally, the [Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/) manual is pretty good to read through, although we probably don't need most of the features from compass.

##Code rules

* Do not version `.css` files. These are compiled by compass, and we don't need to track them
* Set your editor-of-choice to use width 4 soft-tabs (spaces) for indent, and try to follow the indenting already present in the files
* Leave verbose comments using `//`. Most comments are automatically stripped from the output CSS
* Adopt a _fork and pull-request_ approach. Instead of making changes on the main branch, fork it to your own repository, and then make your changes. When you are finished, make a pull request for the changes, and we'll merge them in.


##Installing compass
[This guide](http://compass-style.org/install/) does a far better job explaining how to install stuff. But don't worry if you can't make it work, we can make provisions for you.
